        "\n",
        "* In Python, object-oriented Programming (OOPs) uses objects and classes in programming.\n",
        "* It aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance, polymorphisms, encapsulation, etc. in the programming.\n",
        "* The main concept of OOPs is to bind the data and the functions that work on that together as a single unit so that no other part of the code can access this data.\n",
        "* It comes up with the following advantages:\n",
        "* It helps to divide our over all program into different small segments and thus making it solving easy with the use of objects\n",
        "* Helps in easy maintenance and modification of existing program\n",
        "* Multiple instances of an object can be made."
