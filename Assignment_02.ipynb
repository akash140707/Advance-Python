        "Ans: A Python class is like an outline/blueprint/mold for creating a new object. An object is anything that you wish to manipulate or change while working through the code. Every time a class object is instantiated, which is when we declare a variable, a new object is initiated from scratch\n",
        "\n",
        "Whereas in Python, Modules are simply files with the . py extension containing Python code that can be imported inside another Python Program. In simple terms, we can consider a module to be the same as a code library or a file that contains a set of functions/Classes that you want to include in your application."

        "\n",
        "**Ans:** For creating a class instance. we call a class by its name and pass the arguments which its __init __ method accepts.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example:** vishwak = employee('Male',20000), Here vishwak is an instance of class employee with attriubutes 'Male' and 20000.\n",

        "**Ans:** Instances attributes are passed to the class when an object of the class is created. Unlike class attributes, instance attributes are not shared by all objects of the classs. instead each object maintains its own copy of instance attributes at object level. whereas incase of class attributes all instances of class refer to a single copy. Usually instance attributes are defined within the __init __ method of class\n",
